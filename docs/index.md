    üèÜ TinyMPC has been selected as a finalist for Best Conference Paper Award, Best Student Paper Award, and Best Paper Award in Automation at [IEEE ICRA 2024](https://2024.ieee-icra.org/)! Thank you to everyone who has used TinyMPC and provided feedback!


TinyMPC is an open-source optimization solver tailored for convex model-predictive control, delivering high speed and low memory footprints. Implemented in pure C/C++ with minimal dependencies, this solver is particularly well-suited for embedded control and robotics applications on resource-constrained platforms. Additionally, we provide user-friendly interfaces for seamless integration with high-level languages such as Python, MATLAB, Julia.

## Robot Demonstrations

TinyMPC contributes to bridging the gap between computationally intensive convex model-predictive control and resource-constraint processing platforms. Integrating TinyMPC into computationally underpowered robots enables them to execute agile maneuvers and exhibit safe behaviors.

### Dynamic obstacle avoidance

TinyMPC runs fast enough to enable re-linearizing constraints at each time step, allowing it to reason about moving obstacles, as it is doing in both videos. The algorithm can additionally handle any number of arbitrary linear constraints. On the right, for example, it is avoiding the end of the stick while staying in the yz plane.

### Extreme pose recovery

TinyMPC can enable recovering from extreme initial conditions. In this example, it is compared against three of the [Crazyflie 2.1](https://www.bitcraze.io/products/crazyflie-2-1/){:target="_blank"}'s stock controllers. Only TinyMPC was able to keep the control inputs under the drone's limits, and the recovery looks pretty good!

### Figure-8 tracking

We compared against the same stock controllers for an infeasible figure-8 tracking task (the time given to complete a single figure-8 could only be met if the drone was much more powerful). TinyMPC and PID were able to stay upright, but TinyMPC's trajectory more closely resembled a figure-8.

## Microcontroller Benchmarks

    <div style="text-align: left;">
        TinyMPC outperforms state-of-the-art solvers in terms of speed and memory footprint on microcontroller benchmarks. Here, we solve randomly generated QP MPC problems and compare iteration times and memory footprint against [OSQP](https://osqp.org/){:target="_blank"}. Because TinyMPC takes advantage of the specific structure of the MPC problem, the amount of data it stores scales linearly instead of quadratically with each dimension. This allows it to store much bigger problems (and solve them much faster) than generic QP solvers such as OSQP.

    <div style="text-align: left;">
        TinyMPC is now also capable of handling conic constraints! In (b), we benchmarked TinyMPC against two existing conic solvers with embedded support, [SCS](https://www.cvxgrp.org/scs/){:target="_blank"} and [ECOS](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/papers/ecos.html){:target="_blank"}, on the rocket soft-landing problem. Again, because of its lack of generality, TinyMPC is orders of magnitudes faster than SCS and ECOS.

    ![CDC24 constraint violation benchmarks](media/cdc_bench2.png){ width=40% align=right}
    <div style="text-align: left;">
        Since it's primary use is in real-time control, we also compared TinyMPC's trajectory tracking performance against SCS and ECOS on the rocket soft-landing problem. These tests assume the controller has $\text{Control Step}$ amount of time (in milliseconds) to solve the problem at every real time step (10 milliseconds). TinyMPC beats ECOS in this real-time task because of its ability to warm start each solve with the previous solution, and it performs more iterations per control step than SCS, allowing it to track the reference trajectory more reliably.
